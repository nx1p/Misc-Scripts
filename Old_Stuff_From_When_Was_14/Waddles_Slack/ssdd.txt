Wellll it was kinda hard to find an memory of when I was ashamed of myself since I don't have many recently but going over my life, I just noticed that when I was younger I was kinda ashamed at how good I was at everything and would deliberately make mistakes or stuff that I know people would probably see because then it made me more likeable, less of a weird boy who seemed almost scary in his brilliance at everything and more of a clumsy(which I actually wasn't) normal person. In all honesty I never thought of it like that until now, back then I just thought that making funny mistakes seemed to draw people's attention and did it more often buttt thinking about it now, on some level I must have been ashamed at my lack of social anything.. probably ¡Â\_(?)_/¡Â

Wow. That's amazing though, that you were so brilliant, it was incomprehensible to your peers.

[3:55] 
I'm more of an low-functioning "gifted" person.

Ehhh the way you put it like that you make me sound like I was a genius. I was just 2 or 3 grades ahead of most of my classmates in most subjects in primary school, not like I was some extra special genius D:

Oh except ironically spelling, I was reading at like a year 7 level in  year 3 or 4 I think but my spelling was horrible. It got better around year 5 or so though xD (edited)

Welp that was interesting, I honestly expected a less personal question xD
To me that's like the kind of question you either tell a stranger you're never going to meet again or an extremely trusted person
And I have no extremely trusted friends (in physical world that is)

Huh. But really, you are brilliant if you skipped 2 to 3 grades.

nyx [4:03 AM] 
I didn't skip classes, turns out you need to be good at ?*all*? subjects to skip entire grades plus there also the social problems of being in a class full of people all 2 or 3 years older than you
However for example in grade ?*1*? I was going through the math workbooks they use for grade ?*3*? and in grade 3 I was going through the maths they teach for year ?*5*?, etc (edited)

[4:03] 
So I was in the same classes but certain subjects were more advanced

girl-meets-book [4:04 AM] 
Ah. That sounds like how it is at my high school.

nyx [4:05 AM] 
Ah ok, but I was talking about during primary school

[4:05] 
After primary school I moved to a different school for high school where they teach you differently and you get to pick what you learn instead of following strict instructions
[4:07] 
Like for example last term for Maths I just decided it would be fun to learn about cryptography so I just told my maths teacher such and then I just had to research and learn in my own time and submit a paper on it at the end of the term
[4:07] 
And I don't think cryptography is in the Australian curriculum
[4:07] 
Probably, I'm gonna check now xD
[4:09] 
Nope
[4:09] 
Not in there
